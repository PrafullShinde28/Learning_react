# 🚀 Learning React: From Basics to Advanced Concepts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is part of my journey to **learn, build, and apply React concepts** in real-world scenarios.

---

## 📚 Core Concepts I'm Exploring

### 1. **React Fundamentals**
- Understanding **JSX** and component architecture.
- Practicing **state and UI manipulation** using `useState()` and `useEffect()`.
- Exploring **props** for passing data and **lifting state up**.

### 2. **Component Reusability**
- Creating reusable **presentational and container components**.
- Using **prop drilling** and learning about context to avoid it.
- Building UI with reusability in mind using components like `<Button />`, `<Card />`, etc.

### 3. **Hooks**
- `useState` – for local component state.
- `useEffect` – for side effects like API calls.
- `useRef`, `useContext`, and custom hooks – to handle advanced needs.

### 4. **Routing**
- Implementing **React Router v6+**:
  - `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Navigate`, and dynamic routing.
  - Nested routes and layout components.
  - Route protection using wrapper components.

### 5. **State Management**
- Managing global state with:
  - **Context API** for lightweight apps.
  - **Redux** for scalable state management.
  - **Redux Toolkit** for simplified Redux logic (slices, reducers, async thunks).

### 6. **Class-based Components (Legacy)**
- Learning about `this.state`, `this.props`, lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount()`.
- Comparing class-based vs functional components with hooks.

## 🧪 Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.

### `npm test`
Runs tests in watch mode (coming soon as I integrate **unit and integration tests**).

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.

### `npm run eject`
Use only if I need full control over Webpack and Babel configs.

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far
- ⚛️ React is **declarative**, **component-based**, and supports **fast rendering** via a virtual DOM.
- 🔄 **Hooks** make it easier to handle lifecycle and state in functional components.
- 🧩 **Redux Toolkit** reduces boilerplate in Redux and helps manage async operations (like fetching data).
- 🌐 Routing enables **SPA-like behavior** with clean URLs and transitions.
- 🔄 Understanding **controlled vs uncontrolled** components helps build better forms.
- 🛠 I'm experimenting with **Code Splitting**, **lazy loading**, and **PWA support**.

---

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Add form validation with libraries like **Formik** or **React Hook Form**.
- Integrate testing tools like **Jest**, **React Testing Library**.
- Learn about **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** with **Next.js**.
- Experiment with UI libraries like **Material UI**, **Tailwind CSS**, **ShadCN**.
